# Water Visual Tweaks
You might not like how the water looks by default; use this mod to tweak the scaling and color of the water. This mod is a purely cosmetic mod, it **does not** affect water physics or gameplay. As such, it should be safe to your saves.
# Presets
This mod comes with a default preset. This preset may be updated by me, but they will be not applied automatically, you'll have to click it in the settings. If you decide to modify the settings, it is best to write down your changes in case it gets lost.
# Technical Info
It appears that the water rendering is a slightly modified version of Unity's HDRP water system. The game also uses a custom water material, with a modified water shader. There are 3 Simulation bands at different scales, and each band is simulated. Then their displacements are added together, with smaller bands being tiled. This, along with some other textures and parameters are passed to the water shader. In this mod, the water shader is not modified at all (it would be difficult to do so, if you know how to do so, please let me know). Of course, if CO decides to overhaul the water rendering, this mod will cease to work.
